# SimBMS - Simulate Better Mass Transit

This is a python library oriented towards evaluating and (hopefully) demonstrating the benefits of user-aware bus^1 routing schemes. By user-aware, we mean that bus behavior depends on when and where the riders are, and where they wish to go.


## Notes
^1 This repo is currently bus-oriented in many of the design assumptions, but may at some point be expanded to evaluate mixed fleets (cars, vans, busses, trains, etc).
